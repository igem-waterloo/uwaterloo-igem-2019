    "## LibA-NAT1\n",
    "For the LibA-NAT1 system, assuming that the LibA parameters of $K_m$ anf $V_\\max$ are accurate for our system, we see that at a NAT1 concentration of $10$ picomol, that the system hits a maximum 3,4-DCA concentration of less than a third of the initial Linuron concentration. For all concentrations above $10$ picomol of NAT1, the system can easily handle large concentrations of Linuron and NAT1. Even in the case of the unreasonable rates of influx, $1$ picomol of NAT1 resulted in a steady state concentration of Linuron and 3,4-DCA, around a third of the original concentration, and was well under a third for reasonable rates of influx.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that depending on the particular application, the promoter for NAT1 could be adjusted in order to hit the required 3,4-DCA and Linuron tolerance. Specifically, this demonstrates that our system is not only practical and efficient, but easily extendible to extremely sensitive rhizobia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stochastic models provided little insight into the mechanisms of this system since the system is too simple."

    "## PuhB-NAT1\n",
    "This system was considered because it provided a way to analyze the system under different PuhB concentrations since the $k_{cat}$ value for PuhB with respect to Linuron were found in the literature. From this, we see that the maximum concentration of 3,4-DCA and Linuron can be adjusted to arbitrary ranges depending on the particular application. In particular, we see that even in the case of $1$ picomol of NAT1, if there are $0.01$ picomols of PuhB the system will be able to process Linuron rather effectively given a constant amount of Linuron. In the case of influx however, if there is a large influx of Linuron, the PuhB concentration and NAT1 must be increased in order to maintain a steady state concentration of Linuron and 3,4-DCA such that the rhizobia does not die. In the cases of smaller influxes, it appears that the system is relatively stable and efficient at around $0.01$ picomols of PuhB and $10$ picomols of NAT1. \n",
